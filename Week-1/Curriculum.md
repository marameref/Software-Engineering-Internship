## Week Overview

Week 1 marks the beginning of the formal technical curriculum.

The student will be introduced to software engineering as a discipline, understand the basic components of modern software systems, learn how websites communicate with servers, and begin building webpages using HTML.

The emphasis throughout the week is on understanding concepts and applying them practically rather than memorising terminology.

By the end of the week, the student should be capable of creating a structured HTML webpage independently from a set of requirements.

## 2. What is Software Engineering?

Introduction to software engineering as a discipline.

### Programming

Programming involves writing instructions that computers can execute.

### Software Engineering

Software engineering involves the broader process of:

- Understanding problems
- Gathering requirements
- Planning solutions
- Designing systems
- Writing code
- Testing software
- Deploying software
- Maintaining and improving software

Basic software lifecycle:

```text
Problem
   ↓
Requirements
   ↓
Planning
   ↓
Design
   ↓
Development
   ↓
Testing
   ↓
Deployment
   ↓
Maintenance
```

---

## 3. Requirements Thinking Exercise

Scenario:

> A school currently records student attendance manually and wants software to help manage attendance.

The student will consider:

- What problem needs to be solved?
- Who will use the system?
- What should users be able to do?
- What information should the system store?
- What features might be required?

The objective is to begin thinking about software from the perspective of **problems and requirements**, rather than immediately thinking about code.

---

## 4. Introduction to Software Components

### Frontend

The part of an application users see and interact with.

Examples include:

- Buttons
- Navigation
- Forms
- Text
- Images
- Pages

Common frontend technologies include:

```text
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
```

### Backend

The part of an application responsible for operations behind the user interface.

Examples include:

- Processing information
- Authentication
- Business logic
- Communicating with databases
- Handling requests

### Database

A system used to store and retrieve information.

Examples of information stored by applications include:

- User accounts
- Products

- Transactions

### API

A basic introduction to APIs as a mechanism through which software systems can communicate.

APIs will be studied in greater detail later in the programme.

---

## 5. Basic Application Architecture

Introduction to the relationship between major application components.

```text
User
  ↓
Frontend
  ↓
Backend
  ↓
Database
```

            ↓
Server receives the request
            ↓
Server sends a response
            ↓
Browser displays the webpage
```

---

## 7. Introduction to HTML

**HTML — HyperText Markup Language**

HTML is used to describe the structure and meaning of webpage content.

Create:

```text
Week-01/
└── index.html
```

First HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My First Website</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

The student will:

1. Create the file in VS Code.
2. Save the file.
3. Open the webpage in a browser.
4. Modify the HTML.
5. Refresh the browser.
6. Observe the changes.

## 2. Introduction to Semantic HTML

Semantic HTML uses elements that describe the meaning and purpose of content.

Introduction to:

```html
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<section>
<article>
<footer>
```

Example:

```html
<body>

    <header>
        <h1>My Website</h1>
    </header>

    <nav>
        <!-- Navigation -->
    </nav>

    <main>

        <section>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>...</p>
        </section>

    </main>

    <footer>
        <p>Copyright information</p>
    </footer>

</body>
```

Topics include:

- Meaningful document structure
- Code readability
- Basic accessibility awareness
- Choosing elements based on purpose

---

## 3. Introduction to HTML Forms

Basic example:

```html
<form>

    <label for="email">Email:</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

    <label for="message">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea>

    <button type="submit">Submit</button>

</form>
```

Introduction to:

- `<form>`
- `<label>`
- `<input>`
- `<textarea>`
- `<button>`
- `type`
- `name`
- `id`

The student will also discuss why an HTML-only form does not automatically store or process submitted information.

This reinforces the relationship between the frontend and backend.

---
